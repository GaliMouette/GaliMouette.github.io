## My studies:
I'm at the end of my third year of studies at EPITECH.
During this time I got the chance to work on many computer programming related subjects such as:
- A compiler for the kaleidoscope language written in haskell
- A deep convolutional neural network applied to EEG recording to detect letter we thought about
- An interpreter for [Lindenmayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
- And many more ...

## My work experiences:
During my second year at EPITECH year I landed an internship at [Witekio SAAS France](https://witekio.com/).
I was tasked with implementing a protocol over an SPI interface to enable two devices
to communicate with different messages lengths, as well as adding a letter box system to avoid locking.

During my third year, I joined [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) for an internship with the
[CASH](https://www.inria.fr/en/cash) team. There I worked on the polyhedral model and applied it to multibanking.
This led me to coauthoring my [first research paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03481328/file/RR-9440.pdf).
It was later proposed and accepted as a short paper I presented at the [IMPACT workshop](https://acohen.gitlabpages.inria.fr/impact/impact2022/)
which took place at the [HiPEAC 2022](https://www.hipeac.net/2022/budapest/) conference in Budapest.
